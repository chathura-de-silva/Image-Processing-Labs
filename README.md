# Image-Processing-Labs
Lab exercises covered under " CS3713-Image Processing" module in semester 5, UOM CSE, which had coding involved.


## Point Operations

A Python script to carry out the following operations:

1. Loading a colour image (in JPG or PNG format) from the disk and convert the image to 8-bpp grayscale format.

2. Creating a 3x2 sub-plot and display the gray-scale image and output images images  in different grid positions as follows.

*   grid (1,1) :  unprocessed gray-scale image
*   grid (1,2): negative image
*   grid (1,3): increased brightness by 20% on each pixel
*   grid (2,1): Reduce image contrast such that gray levels remain between 125 and 175
*   grid (2,2): Reduce image gray level depth to 4bpp from 8 bpp
*   grid (2,3): Vertical mirror image of the unprocessed image


(OpenCV library, only for loading the source image and saving your output.  No other libraries (except for matplotlib, numpy))
